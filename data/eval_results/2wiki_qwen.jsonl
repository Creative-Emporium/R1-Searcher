As Mieszko III was the son of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by his second wife Salomea, historians considered that Dobroniega Ludgarda had the same parents. Due to chronology it is impossible for Dobroniega to be a daughter of Boles\u0142aw III from his first marriage with Zbyslava of Kiev. She was named Dobroniega after her paternal great-grandmother, Maria Dobroniega of Kiev.

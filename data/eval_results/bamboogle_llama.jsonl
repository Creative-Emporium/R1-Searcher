In 1837, the personal union of the thrones of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended with the death of William IV. Succession to the Hanoverian throne was regulated by semi-Salic law (agnatic-cognatic), which gave priority to all male lines before female lines, so that it passed not to Queen Victoria but to her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland.

It is the C5 epimer of etiocholanedione (5\u03b2-androstanedione). Androstanedione is formed from androstenedione by 5\u03b1-reductase and from DHT by 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. It has some androgenic activity.

It is closely related to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol). Biological function. Androstenedione is a precursor of testosterone and other androgens, as well as of estrogens like estrone, in the body. In addition to functioning as an endogenous prohormone, androstenedione also has weak androgenic activity in its own right. Androstenedione has been found to possess some estrogenic activity, similarly to other DHEA metabolites. However, in contrast to androstenediol, its affinity\n(4)Androstenedione   testosterone levels were below detection. Biochemistry. Biochemistry.:Biosynthesis. Androstenedione is the common precursor of the androgen and estrogen sex hormones. Androstenedione can be biosynthesized in one of two ways. The primary pathway involves conversion of 17\u03b1-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA by way of 17,20-lyase, with subsequent conversion of DHEA to androstenedione via the enzyme 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The secondary pathway involves conversion of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone, most often a precursor to cortisol, to androstenedione directly by way of 17,20-lyase. Thus, 17,20-lyase is required for the synthesis of androstenedione, whether immediately or one step removed. Androstenedione is produced in the adrenal glands and the gonads.

Jefferson assumed the office after defeating incumbent President John Adams in the 1800 presidential election. The election was a realigning election in which the Democratic-Republican Party swept the Federalist Party out of power, ushering in a generation of Democratic-Republican dominance in American politics. After serving two terms, Jefferson was succeeded by Secretary of State James Madison, also of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson took office determined to roll back\n(2)Presidency of Thomas Jefferson   which called for national unity.

Previously, he had served as the second vice president of the United States from 1797 to 1801.

Even in Jefferson's absence, the plantation was generating revenue from slave labor under the watch of a general steward and a team of overseers; the slave labor force at Poplar Forest produced annual tobacco and wheat crops after 1790.

The narrator, who fell in love with Annabel Lee when they were young, has a love for her so strong that even angels are envious. He retains his love for her even after her death.

Biographers and critics usually suggest Poe's frequent use of the \"death of a beautiful woman\" theme stems from the repeated loss of women throughout his own life, including his mother Eliza Poe and his foster mother Frances Allan.

It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch granules have been removed, leaving the sticky insoluble gluten as an elastic mass which is then cooked before being eaten. The name Seitan is now widely used in vegetarian, vegan, wholefood and macrobiotic circles for wheat gluten dishes. Wheat gluten is an alternative to soybean-based foods such as tofu, which are sometimes used as meat substitutes. Some types of wheat gluten have a chewy or stringy texture that resembles meat\n(3)Camel   A camel carcass can provide a substantial amount of meat.

The inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet remains controversial, and may depend on the oat cultivar and the frequent cross-contamination with other gluten-containing cereals. Gluten may cause both gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms for those with gluten-related disorders, including coeliac disease (CD), non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), gluten ataxia, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and wheat allergy.

The lake is divided among four countries \u2013 Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Burundi, and Zambia, with Tanzania (46%) and DRC (40%) possessing the majority of the lake.

The film takes us from the mouth to the source of the second largest river basin in the world, that of the Congo River (the largest is the Amazon). All along its 4371 km, we discover places that have seen the turbulent history of this country, while archives remind us of the mythological figures that created its destiny: explorers such as Livingstone and Stanley, the colonial kings Leopold II and Baudouin and leaders such as Lumumba, Mobutu and\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that Lake Tanganyika is the second-deepest lake in the world, but I couldn't find specific information about the length of the second deepest river in the world.

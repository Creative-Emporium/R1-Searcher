The campaign was developed from December 1974 by the Irish Goods Council, originally the Working Group on the Promotion and Sale of Irish Goods within the National Development Association, which was incorporated separately in 1978.  The Council's first director, Vivian Murray, was instrumental in the campaign.  Awareness of the logo was fostered by advertisements on RT\u00c9 Television.  Spending on the campaign increased from \u00a390,376 in 1976 to \u00a3361,491 in 1981.  In 1980, 1,000 companies were participating.  Capital Spicer exercise books used in schools exposed children to the logo.  In 1982, the European Court of Justice ruled that, since the Irish Goods Council received state funding, its Guaranteed Irish campaign contravened the Treaty of Rome's rules against protectionism.  As a consequence the campaign was separated from the Irish Goods Council into a new organisation, Guaranteed Irish Limited, which does not receive state funding.  It was launched in 1984 by Patrick Hillery, then President of Ireland.\"\n(3)\"Title: Just Say No Text:  \"\"Just Say No\"\" was an advertising campaign, part of the U.S. \"\"War on Drugs\"\", prevalent during the 1980s and early 1990s, to discourage children from engaging in illegal recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying \"\"no\"\".

In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"\"batting title\"\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"\"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\"\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"\"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\"\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.\"\n(2)\"Title: American League Text:  The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada.  It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status.

The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (NL) was formed in Chicago, Illinois by businessman, and owner of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as, the Chicago Cubs), William Hulbert, for the purpose of replacing the NA, which he believed to have been corrupt, mismanaged, full of rowdy, drunken ballplayers, and under the influence of the gambling community.  One of the new rules put into place by the new league was that all teams had to be located in cities that had a population of 75,000 or more.  The initial NL season began with eight teams, and they were asked to play seventy games between April 22 and October 21.  The NL is considered to be the first \"\"major league\"\", although it has been argued that the NA can make that claim.\"\n(4)Title: Interleague play Text:  Interleague play in Major League Baseball refers to regular-season baseball games played between an American League (AL) team and a National League (NL) team.  Interleague play was first introduced in the 1997 Major League Baseball season.  Prior to that, matchups between AL teams and NL teams occurred only during spring training, the All-Star Game, other exhibition games (such as the Hall of Fame Game in Cooperstown, New York), and the World Series.  Unlike modern interleague play, none of these contests, except for the World Series, counted toward official team or league records.\n(5)Title: Designated hitter Text:  In baseball, the designated hitter rule is the common name for Major League Baseball Rule 5.11, adopted by the American League in 1973.  The rule allows teams to have one player, known as the designated hitter (abbreviated DH), to bat in place of the pitcher.  Since 1973, most collegiate, amateur, and professional leagues have adopted the rule or some variant.  MLB's National League and Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that the American League has a designated hitter rule, which allows a player to bat in place of the pitcher, while the National League does not.

MLB's National League and Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter.\n(2)Title: History of the American League Text:  The History of the American League, officially known as the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs and often abbreviated AL, stretched back into the late-19th century.  Prior to 2000, when the AL and NL were dissolved as separate entities and merged into the organization called Major League Baseball, the American League was one of the two leagues that made up major league baseball.  Originally a minor league known as the Western League, the league later developed into a major league after the American Association disbanded.  In its early history, the Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league.  Johnson led the Western League into major league status and soon became the president of the newly renamed American League.  The American League has one notable difference over the National League, and that is the designated hitter rule.  Under the rule, a team may use a batter in their lineup who is not in the field defensively, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to hit.\n(3)\"Title: List of Major League Baseball batting champions Text:  In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).

In the American League, a pinch hitter is usually substituted for the position player in whose place he batted (although another common substitution is pinch-hitting a utility infielder for a second baseman and subsequently switching him for the shortstop in the field while moving the shortstop over to the now-vacant second base position).  In the National League, which does not use the designated hitter rule, pinch hitters sometimes bat for pitchers. However, another common pitcher-substitution strategy in the NL is the double switch, in which a pitching change is coupled with a pinch-hitter who is also defensively substituted for a second player.\n(5)\"Title: American League Text:  The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada.

Despite their work, the Bandit never went into commercial production, and only five have survived, making them very rare.  Doug Hele stated that the model was dropped because design doubts such as the rapid wear of contact breaker points, did not justify the 'real money' cost of dies for components such as cylinder heads, the company then being in 'real financial trouble'.  This was despite the fact that Hele expected full production to follow after twelve pre-production models were made.  Indeed, the Bandit was included in the 1971 brochure and publicity photographs taken at Umberslade Hall and featuring British speedway rider and Triumph production tester Tony Lomas with the British model Carol Cleveland (famous for British TV comedy Monty Python) had already been produced.  Hopwood did note that the production release date was constantly delayed from spring 1971 with even autumn 1972 suggested gravely affecting BSA-Triumph's credibility with dealers especially in the critical US market.\n(5)\"Title: Time Bandit Text:  Time Bandit is an action/adventure video game that was written originally for the TRS-80 Model I and soon ported to the TRS-80 Color Computer and Dragon 32, but enjoyed its greatest popularity with the 1985 version for the Atari ST and Amiga.

Although they are clothoid-shaped, their shape is closer to circular than the ones on most other roller coasters, so they exert unusually high \"\"g\"\"-forces on the passengers (up to 5.2 g).  The entire structure weighs 900 tons and requires a space 85 m wide by 36 m deep.

The earliest recordings on this album, done between fall 1960 and fall 1961, feature the Supremes as a quartet composed of teenagers Diane Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, and Barbara Martin.  Martin left the group in early 1962 to start a family, and the other three girls continued as a trio.  Martin is not pictured on the album because of her departure earlier in the year; although her vocals are present on the majority of the recordings on the album (as well as other recordings made during that period), she never received any royalties from album sales.  She does have a spoken interlude line (as do the other group members) on the bridge of the song \"\"(He's) Seventeen\"\", and also sings lead on \"\"After All\"\", a song recorded for but not originally included on the album.  Along with these songs, Ballard and Wilson are heard out front on other songs as well.  Wilson sings lead on \"\"The Tears\"\" (another former non-album track) and \"\"Baby Don't Go\"\"; Ballard has leads on a handful of songs as well (see below), including \"\"Buttered Popcorn\"\" and the short intro line to \"\"Let Me Go the Right Way\"\".\"\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that The Supremes was founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959.</think>\n\n<answer>The Primettes</answer>", "gpt4o_output": "True"}

Tchaikovsky wanted to write professional compositions of such quality that they would stand up to Western scrutiny and thus transcend national barriers, yet remain distinctively Russian in melody, rhythm and other compositional characteristics.  The Five, made up of composers Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, C\u00e9sar Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, sought to produce a specifically Russian kind of art music, rather than one that imitated older European music or relied on European-style conservatory training.  While Tchaikovsky himself used folk songs in some of his works, for the most part he tried to follow Western practices of composition, especially in terms of tonality and tonal progression.  Also, unlike Tchaikovsky, none of The Five were academically trained in composition; in fact, their leader, Balakirev, considered academicism a threat to musical imagination.  Along with critic Vladimir Stasov, who supported The Five, Balakirev attacked relentlessly both the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which Tchaikovsky had graduated, and its founder Anton Rubinstein, orally and in print.\n(5)\"Title: Rodion Shchedrin Text:  Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043e\u0301\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0429\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0301\u043d , \"\"Rodion Konstantinovi\u010d \u0160\u010dedrin\"\", ] ; born 16 December 1932) is a Russian composer and pianist, winner of the Lenin Prize (1984), USSR State Prize (1972), and the State Prize of the Russian Federation (1992), and is a former member of the Interregional Deputy Group (1989\u20131991).

The submarines can operate at high speed on diesel power or switch to the AIP system for silent slow cruising, staying submerged for up to three weeks without surfacing and with little exhaust heat.  The system is also said to be vibration-free, extremely quiet and virtually undetectable.\n(3)\"Title: Nuclear submarine Text:  A nuclear submarine is a submarine powered by a nuclear reactor.  The performance advantages of nuclear submarines over \"\"conventional\"\" (typically diesel-electric) submarines are considerable.  Nuclear propulsion, being completely independent of air, frees the submarine from the need to surface frequently, as is necessary for conventional submarines.  The large amount of power generated by a nuclear reactor allows nuclear submarines to operate at high speed for long periods of time; and the long interval between refuelings grants a range limited only by consumables such as food.\"\n(4)\"Title: Ballistic missile submarine Text:  A ballistic missile submarine is a submarine deploying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads.  The United States Navy's hull classification symbols for ballistic missile submarines are SSB and SSBN \u2013 the \"\"SS\"\" denotes submarine (or submersible ship), the \"\"B\"\" denotes ballistic missile, and the \"\"N\"\" denotes that the submarine is nuclear powered.  These submarines became a major weapon system in the Cold War because of their nuclear deterrence capability.  They can fire missiles thousands of kilometers from their targets, and acoustic quieting makes them difficult to detect (see acoustic signature), thus making them a survivable deterrent in the event of a first strike and a key element of the mutual assured destruction policy of nuclear deterrence.  Their deployment has been dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union / Russia, with smaller numbers in service with France, the United Kingdom, China, and most recently India.\"\n(5)Title: Type 032 submarine Text:  The Type 032 submarine (NATO reporting name: Qing-class) is a class of diesel-electric submarine currently undergoing testing in China's People's Liberation Army Navy.  It is said to be the world's largest conventional submarine, at a submerged displacement of 6,628 tonnes and is able to submerge for a maximum of 30 days.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that the Type 212 submarine is a non-nuclear submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG for the German and Italian navies.

With an age of approximately 13.6 billion years, it is one of the oldest stars known.  Another star, HD 140283, is considered to be older, but there is uncertainty in values of its age.  This makes SM0313 the oldest known star with an accurate determination of its age.  The star formed only about 100 million years after the Big Bang, and has been shining for 13.6 billion years.  The star's very low upper limit of iron of less than one ten millionth the iron level of the Sun, suggests that it is one of the first Population II stars, formed from a gas cloud enriched by some of the very first (Population III) stars.  SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 also has a much higher carbon supply compared to iron, more than a thousand times greater.  Apart from hydrogen, which appeared in the Big Bang, the star also contains carbon, magnesium, and calcium which could have been formed in a low energy supernova.  Methylidyne (CH) is also detected by its absorption line.  No oxygen or nitrogen have been detected.  The star is a K class dwarf.\n(4)Title: W75N(B)-VLA2 Text:  W75N(B)-VLA2 is a massive protostar some 4,200 light-years from Earth, about 8 times more massive and 300 times brighter than our Sun, observed in 1996 and 2014 by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).  In 2014 its stellar wind had changed from a compact spherical form to a larger thermal, ionized elliptical one outlining collimated motion, giving critical insight into the very early stages of the formation of a massive star.  Being able to observe its rapid growth as it happens (in real time in an astronomical context) is unique, according to Huib van Langevelde of Leiden University, one of the authors of a study of the object.\n(5)Title: Giant-impact hypothesis Text:  The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Big Splash, or the Theia Impact suggests that the Moon formed out of the debris left over from a collision between Earth and an astronomical body the size of Mars, approximately 4.5 billion years ago, in the Hadean eon; about 20 to 100 million years after the solar system coalesced.  The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, from the name of the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon.  Analysis of lunar rocks, published in a 2016 report, suggests that the impact may have been a direct hit, causing a thorough mixing of both parent bodies.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that Young the Giant was formed in 2009, and Wire was formed in 1976.

They urged the campaign staff of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who had conceded the campaign on November 9, to petition for a recount in three key states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.  When the Clinton campaign declined to file for recounts, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein agreed to spearhead the recount effort on November 23, on the grounds that unspecified \"\"anomalies\"\" may have affected the election's outcome.  The Clinton team subsequently pledged to support the recount efforts \"\"in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\"\"  President-elect Trump and his supporters filed legal motions in all three states to prevent the recounts.  Two other states were the subject of recount bids that were separate from Stein's efforts in the Rust Belt states: American Delta Party/Reform Party presidential candidate Rocky De La Fuente filed for a partial recount in Nevada on November 30, and three Florida citizens filed for a complete hand recount in their state on December 6.\"\n(4)Title: United States presidential election, 2016 Text:  The United States presidential election of 2016 was the 58th quadrennial American presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

It was developed in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century.  Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct by the turn of the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest.  One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings.  It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia.  The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK).

They are very popular in Australia due to their temperaments.  The Beaglier typically has the shorter and more rounded muzzle of the Cavalier.  Beagliers have variable coat colours and markings.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that the French Spaniel is recognized by Canadian and international kennel clubs, but not by The Kennel Club (UK).

It is a political movement which spans the better part of the last four centuries, though the use of the word \"\"liberalism\"\" to refer to a specific political doctrine did not occur until the 19th century.  The Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England laid the foundations for the development of the modern liberal state by constitutionally limiting the power of the monarch, affirming parliamentary supremacy, passing the Bill of Rights and establishing the principle of 'consent of the governed'.  The 1776 Declaration of Independence of the United States of America founded the nascent republic on liberal principles without the encumbrance of hereditary aristocracy; the declaration stated that \"\"all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\"\" echoing John Locke's phrase \"\"life, liberty, and property\"\".  A few years later, the French Revolution overthrew the hereditary aristocracy, with the slogan \"\"liberty, equality, fraternity\"\", and was the first state in history to grant universal male suffrage.  The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, first codified in 1789 in France, is a foundational document of both liberalism and human rights.\"\n(3)Title: John Locke (MP) Text:  John Locke (1805 \u2013 28 January 1880) was an English barrister, author and Liberal Party politician.\n(4)Title: John Lok Text:  John Lok was the son of Sir William Lok, great-great-great-grandfather of the philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704).

One legal authority wrote that such a performance, \"\"though probably not necessary to fulfill any legal requirement, permits registration of first performance at Stationers' Hall and gives useful public notice to possible infringers.\"\"  The practice was common in the decades after the Berne Convention of 1886; the United States was not a signatory, and plays first staged there were uncopyrightable in the United Kingdom.\"\n(3)Title: Music in the plays of William Shakespeare Text:  Music in the plays of William Shakespeare includes both music incidental to the plot, as song and dance, and also additional supplied both by Shakespeare's own company and subsequent performers.

Around the summer solstice (approximately 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 December in the Southern Hemisphere) the sun is visible for the full 24 hours, given fair weather.  The number of days per year with potential midnight sun increases the closer towards either pole one goes.  Although approximately defined by the polar circles, in practice the midnight sun can be seen as much as 55 miles (90\u00a0km) outside the polar circle, as described below, and the exact latitudes of the farthest reaches of midnight sun depend on topography and vary slightly year-to-year.\n(2)Title: Midnight Sun (disambiguation) Text:  A midnight sun occurs when the sun is visible at midnight, local time.\n(3)Title: Solar phenomena Text:  Solar phenomena are the natural phenomena occurring within the magnetically heated outer atmospheres in the Sun.  These phenomena take many forms, including solar wind, radio wave flux, energy bursts such as solar flares, coronal mass ejection or solar eruptions, coronal heating and sunspots.\n(4)Title: Sunbreak Text:  A sunbreak is a natural phenomenon in which sunlight obscured over a relatively large area penetrates the obscuring material in a localized space.  The typical example is of sunlight shining through a hole in cloud cover.  A sunbreak piercing clouds normally produces a visible shaft of light reflected by atmospheric dust, called a sunbeam.  Another form of sunbreak occurs when sunlight passes into an area otherwise shadowed by surrounding large buildings through a gap temporarily aligned with the position of the sun.\n(5)\"Title: Lahaina Noon Text:  L\u0101hain\u0101 Noon is a tropical solar phenomenon when the Sun culminates at the zenith at solar noon, passing directly overhead (above the subsolar point).

This occurs only inside the polar circles.  The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24\u00a0hours.  \"\"Night\"\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon.  Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun.  The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees.  In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67\u00b051'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods.

A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness.  Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.\n(5)\"Title: Midnight Sun Game Text:  The Midnight Sun Game is an amateur baseball game played every summer solstice at Growden Memorial Park in Fairbanks, Alaska, United States.  Because the sun is out for almost 24 hours a day, the game starts at about 10:30 at night and completes around 1:30 the next morning.  However, because Fairbanks's summer time zone differs by about 2 hours from local solar time, the game may not actually last until solar midnight, at about 1:53.

The ride opened in 2013, replacing The Rattler, a wooden roller coaster, by putting a new steel track on top of The Rattler's wooden support structure.  The distance between the lowest and highest points of the first drop was increased from 124 to and the drop was made steeper by changing the angle to 81 degrees.  The resulting modifications increased the speed of the trains from 65 to .  It is the first hybrid wood and steel roller coaster to feature an inversion, in which riders are turned upside-down and then back upright.  The inversion is a zero-g-roll, which is when the train goes through a combination of a loop and a roll.\n(2)\"Title: Rattleback Text:  A rattleback is a semi-ellipsoidal top which will rotate on its axis in a preferred direction.

It is a trajectory optimization that uses gravity to steer the vehicle onto its desired trajectory.  It offers two main advantages over a trajectory controlled solely through the vehicle's own thrust.  First, the thrust is not used to change the spacecraft's direction, so more of it is used to accelerate the vehicle into orbit.  Second, and more importantly, during the initial ascent phase the vehicle can maintain low or even zero angle of attack.  This minimizes transverse aerodynamic stress on the launch vehicle, allowing for a lighter launch vehicle.\n(4)\"Title: Dutch roll Text:  Dutch roll is a type of aircraft motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of \"\"tail-wagging\"\" and rocking from side to side.  This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence).  This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases.  Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper.  Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with yaw dampers.\"\n(5)Title: Zero-velocity surface Text:  The zero-velocity surface is a concept that relates to the N-body problem of gravity.  It represents a surface a body of given energy cannot cross, since it would have zero velocity on the surface.  It was first introduced by George William Hill.  The zero-velocity surface is particularly significant when working with weak gravitational interactions among orbiting bodies.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that a barrel roll is an aerial maneuver, and I couldn't find specific information about a common feature that it shares with the Iron Rattler's inversion.

In some traditions, especially German and Nordic heraldry, two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single achievement of arms, each representing a fief to which the bearer has a right.

The battle resulted in an English victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry.

A year later, Harwick Johnson filed a patent for a prototype integrated circuit (IC).\n(2)\"Title: Bernard A Yurash Text:  Bernard A Yurash (February 17, 1921 \u2013 January 25, 2007) was a significant contributor to the creation of the first commercially viable CMOS integrated circuits by finding the sources of mobile sodium ions coming from the manufacturing process.  Today, virtually all digital electronics use CMOS circuitry.  Bernard worked at Fairchild Semiconductor in Silicon Valley from 1958 ( he was employee number 158 ), through the buyouts of the company by Schlumberger and National Semiconductor, and finally retiring in 1990.  In the 1960s Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., and Texas Instruments, revolutionized electronics by employing the first integrated circuit technology.  Fairchild's Robert Noyce filed for this patent using deposited (printed) metal lines and Jean Hoerni's Planar Process ( patent also filed by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments but with using bonding wires ).  At the time virtually all the devices were of the bipolar type which were used to construct RTL and DTL type circuits ( Resistor-Transistor-Logic, Diode-Transistor-Logic), which unfortunately drew more power than was desired, and eventually lost ground to Texas Instruments' TTL (Transistor-Transistor-logic).  The next great technological leap in computer chips would be CMOS transistors, which promised significantly lower power and greater circuit density than the Bipolar circuitry.  Although Frank Wanlass first filed for the CMOS patent in 1963, Fairchild could not produce the devices for commercial output for many years because of the mystery of the mobile ions degrading their performance.  Much research time and money was expended in 1967 and 1968 at Fairchild on trying to manufacture the highly promising technology, the MOS SGT ( Metal Oxide Semiconductor Silicon Gate Technology ) circuits utilizing the field effect from the \"\"gate\"\" on the conducting \"\"channel\"\" from source to drain.\"\n(3)\"Title: Integrated circuit Text:  An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one small flat piece (or \"\"chip\"\") of semiconductor material, normally silicon.  The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper, and faster than those constructed of discrete electronic components.  The IC's mass production capability, reliability and building-block approach to circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors.  ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of electronics.  Computers, mobile phones, and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs.\"\n(4)Title: Moore's law Text:  Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.  The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.  In 1975, looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years.  The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).\n(5)Title: Magnetoelectric effect Text:  In its most general form, the magnetoelectric effect (ME) denotes any coupling between the magnetic and the electric properties of a material.  The first example of such an effect was described by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen in 1888, who found that a dielectric material moving through an electric field would become magnetized.

Most video game consoles come with the accessories required to play games out of the box (minus software): one A/V cable, one AC cable, and a controller.  Memory is usually the most required accessory outside of these, as game data cannot be saved to compact discs.  The companies that manufacture video game consoles also make these accessories for replacement purposes (AC cords and A/V cables) as well as improving the overall experience (extra controllers for more players, or unique devices like light guns and dance pads).  There is an entire industry of companies that create accessories for consoles as well, called third-party companies.  The prices are often lower than those made by the maker of the console (first-party).  This is usually achieved by avoiding licensing or using cheaper materials.  For the mobile systems like the PlayStation Portable and Game Boy iterations, there are many accessories to make them more usable in mobile environments, such as mobile chargers, lighting to improve visibility, and cases to both protect and help organize the collection of system peripherals to.  Newer accessories include many home-made things like mod chips to bypass manufacturing protection or homemade software.\n(5)Title: Accessory (band) Text:  Accessory is a German synthpop/electro-industrial group consisting of Dirk Steyer and Ivo Lottig.

The domino game Texas 42 is an example of a trick-taking game that is not a card game.\"\n(5)Title: Revoke Text:  In trick-taking card games, a revoke (or renege, or ) is a violation of the rules regarding the play of tricks serious enough to render the round invalid.  A revoke is a violation ranked in seriousness somewhat below overt cheating but is considered a minor offense when unintentional.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that a holdout is an accessory used by cheats to help them \"hold-out\" a card during a card game, but I couldn't find specific information about what the cheats receive.

The term usually refers to house-banked games, but can also refer to games played against other players, such as poker.  Someone who practices advantage gambling is often referred to as an advantage player, or AP.  Unlike cheating, which is by definition illegal, advantage play exploits innate characteristics of a particular game to give the player an advantage relative to the house or other players.  While not illegal, advantage play is often discouraged and some advantage players may be banned from certain casinos.\n(2)Title: Cheat (game) Text:  Cheat (also known as B.S., bluff, and I-doubt-it) is a card game where the players aim to get rid of all of their cards.  It is a game of deception, with cards being played face-down and players being permitted to lie about the cards they have played.  A challenge is usually made by players calling out the name of the game, and the loser of a challenge has to pick up every card in the middle.\n(3)\"Title: Card advantage Text:  Card advantage (often abbreviated CA) is a term used in collectible card game strategy to indicate one player having access to more cards than another player, usually by drawing more cards through in-game effects.  The concept was first described early in the evolution of \"\"\"\" strategy, where many early decks relied on a player drawing more cards than their opponent, and then using this advantage to play more cards and advance their position faster than their opponent.  By 2007 it was recognized as one of the most important indicators of who is ahead in a game and has been utilized in the development of strategy for nearly every collectible card game created.\"\n(4)\"Title: Hacker (card game) Text:  Hacker is a card game (not a trading card game) made by Steve Jackson Games (SJG).  Published in 1992, the players impersonate hackers fighting for the control of computer networks.  It is based primarily on interlocking access to different computer systems in the web.  Players are not set directly towards each other, and several players can share access to a system.  It is superficially similar (modulo terminology) to the game \"\"Illuminati\"\".  \"\"Hacker\"\" is currently out of print.\"\n(5)Title: Cheating in poker Text:  Cheating in poker is any behavior outside the rules that is intended to give an unfair advantage to one or more players.\n<|end_of_documents|>\n\nBased on the search results, I found that a holdout is an accessory used by cheats to help them \"hold-out\" a card during a card game, and I couldn't find specific information about what the cheats receive.

Its precursor was from a non-tropical trough east of Florida, and on August\u00a010 it developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico.  It was the fifth depression of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.  The system was declassified as a tropical cyclone the following day, a remnant circulation later moved over Louisiana and Mississippi, producing heavy rainfall and causing flooding.

In the early 1900s, Chicago boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers.  Essanay Studios founded by George K. Spoor was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson.  Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios \"\"Broncho Billie\"\" Anderson gave birth to the western genre.  Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public.  This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the Great Depression.  However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed.  The Motion Picture Patents Company, established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment.  As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene.  Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company.  The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making.  Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival.  Blockbusters, such as \"\"Blues Brothers\"\", \"\"Sixteen Candles\"\", and \"\"The Dark Knight\"\", have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene.  In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.\"\n(5)Title: Christian film industry Text:  The Christian film industry is an umbrella term for films containing a Christian themed message or moral, produced by Christian filmmakers to a Christian audience, and films produced by non-Christians with Christian audiences in mind.

It fires two small dart-like electrodes, which stay connected to the main unit by conductors, to deliver electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles causing \"\"neuromuscular incapacitation\"\".  Someone struck by a Taser experiences extreme pain and over-stimulation of sensory nerves and motor nerves, resulting in strong involuntary muscle contractions.  Tasers will incapacitate, not just cause pain compliance, and are thus preferred by some law enforcement over non-Taser stun guns and other electronic control weapons, which, like a Taser when used solely in \"\"Drive Stun\"\" mode, can only do the latter.\"\n(2)Title: World Armwrestling Federation Text:  The World Armwrestling Federation (WAF) is an international federation of national and regional arm wrestling associations.\n(3)\"Title: Ultimate Tazer Ball Text:  Ultimate Tazer Ball, also known as \"\"UTB\"\" and \"\"UTB Live\"\", is an extreme sport involving the use of stun devices.\"\n(4)\"Title: In Your House 9: International Incident Text:  In Your House 9: International Incident was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), that took place on July 21, 1996, at General Motors Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Two of Kulas' arteries were severed; he bled profusely and passed out, and needed to be escorted out of the arena with medical attention.  Further controversy arose when it came to light that Kulas had lied to ECW owner and booker Paul Heyman about his age and professional wrestling training.

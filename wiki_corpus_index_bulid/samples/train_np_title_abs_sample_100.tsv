Albanerpetontids were long thought to be salamanders because of their small size and generalized body plans.  However, these features are now thought to be ancestral for lissamphibians and not indicative of close relationships between the two groups.  One of the things that made them different from salamanders was that their skin was covered with bony scales.  Albanerpetontids are now recognized as a distinct clade of lissamphibians separate from the three living orders of amphibians – Anura (frogs), Caudata (salamanders), and Gymnophiona (caecilians).  Some studies show them as more closely related to frogs and salamanders than to caecilians, while others show them to be outside of the lissamphibian crown-group."
